\section{The Real Number System}
\subsection{The Set of Real Numbers}
We define:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The set of natural numbers is \(\N=\{1,2,3,\dots\}\).
    \item The set of integers is \(\Z=\{0,1,-1,2,-2,\dots\}\).
    \item The set of rational numbers is
    \(\Q=\left\{\frac{m}{n}\mid m,n\in\Z,n\neq0\right\}\).
    \item The set of real numbers is \(\R\).
\end{enumerate}
Note that \(\N\subset\Z\subset\Q\subset\R\).
\begin{definition}[Well Ordering Property of \(\N\)]
    Every nonempty subset of \(\N\) has a least element.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    An ordered set is a set \(S\) with a relation \(<\) such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item (Trichtomy) If \(x,y\in S\), then one and only one of
        the statements \(x<y,x=y,y<x\) is true.
        \item (Transitivity) If \(x,y,z\in S\), \(x<y\), and \(y<z\),
        then \(x<z\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    Suppose \(S\) is an ordered set and \(E\subset S\).
    If there exists a \(b\in S\) such that \(x\leq b\) for all \(x\in E\),
    then \(E\) is bounded above and \(b\) is an upper bound
    of \(E\).
    If there exists an upper bound \(a\) such that \(a\leq b\) for all upper
    bounds \(b\) of \(E\), then \(a\) is the least upper bound or the
    supremum of \(E\) and we write \(\sup E=a\).
\end{definition}
Similar definition applies for a set that is bounded below by a
lower bound.
The greatest lower bound or the infimum of \(E\) is denoted
by \(\inf E\).
\begin{definition}
    A set is bounded if it is bounded above and below.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Dedekind Completeness]
    An ordered set \(S\) has the least-upper-bound property if every
    nonempty subset \(E\subset S\) that is bounded above has a least upper
    bound, that is, \(\sup E\) exists in \(S\).
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    There exists a unique ordered field \(\R\) with the least-upper-bound
    property such that \(\Q\subset\R\).
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Archimedian Property}
\begin{theorem}
    If \(x\in\R\) and \(x\leq\varepsilon\) for all real numbers
    \(\varepsilon>0\), then \(x\leq0\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
    Suppose \(x,y\in\R\).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item (Archimedian property) If \(x>0\), then there exists an
        \(n\in\N\) such that \(nx>y\).
        \item (\(\Q\) is dense in \(\R\)) If \(x<y\), then there exists an
        \(r\in\Q\) such that \(x<r<y\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
If \(A\subset\R\) and \(\sup A\in A\), then the supremum is the
maximum of \(A\) denoted by \(\max A\).
Similarly, the infimum is the minimum of \(A\) denoted by \(\min A\).
\begin{theorem}[Triangle Inequality]
    If \(x,y\in\R\), then \(|x+y|\leq|x|+|y|\).
\end{theorem}

\section{Sequences and Series}
\subsection{Sequences}
\begin{definition}
    A sequence \(\left\{x_n\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is a function
    with domain \(\N\) and codomain \(\R\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A sequence \(\{x_n\}\) is bounded if there exists a \(B\in\R\)
    such that \(|x_n|\leq B\) for all \(n\in\N\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A sequence is convergent and has the limit \(L\) and we
    write
    \[\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=L\]
    if for every \(\varepsilon>0\) there exists an \(N\in\N\) such that
    \(|x_n-L|<\varepsilon\) for all \(n\geq N\).
\end{definition}
If a sequence is not convergent, then it is divergent.
\begin{theorem}
    A convergent sequence has a unique limit.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
    If a sequence is convergent, then it is bounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Squeeze Theorem]
    If \(a_n\leq b_n\leq c_n\) for all \(n\geq N\), and
    \(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}c_n=L\), then
    \[\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n=L.\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Monotonic Sequences}
\begin{definition}
    A sequence \(\{x_n\}\) is increasing if \(x_n\leq x_{n+1}\) for
    all \(n\in\N\).
    \(\{x_n\}\) is decreasing if \(x_n\geq x_{n+1}\) for all
    \(n\in\N\).
    A sequence is monotonic if it is increasing or decreasing.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Monotone Convergence Theorem]
    A monotonic sequence is convergent if and only if it is bounded.
If \(\{x_n\}\) is increasing and bounded above, then
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=\sup x_n.\]
If \(\{x_n\}\) is decreasing and bounded below, then
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=\inf x_n.\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Subsequences}
\begin{definition}
    Let \(n_k\) be a sequence with \(n_k<n_{k+1}\) for all \(k\in\N\).
    The sequence \(\{x_{n_k}\}\) is a subsequence of \(\{x_n\}\).
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    If \(\{x_n\}\) is convergent, then every subsequence \(\{x_{n_k}\}\) is
    convergent, and
    \[\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=\lim_{i\to\infty}x_{n_k}.\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem]
    Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Cauchy Sequences}
\begin{definition}
    A sequence \(\{x_n\}\) is a Cauchy sequence if for every
    \(\varepsilon>0\) there exists an \(N\in\N\) such that
    \(|x_m-x_n|<\varepsilon\) for all \(m,n\geq\N\).
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    If a sequence is a Cauchy sequence, then it is bounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy Completeness]
    A sequence is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.
\end{theorem}
